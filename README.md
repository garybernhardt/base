# Base

* http://github.com/garybernhardt/base

## DESCRIPTION:

People love Base classes! They have tons of methods waiting to be used. Just check out ActiveRecord::Base's method list:

    >> ActiveRecord::Base.methods.length
    => 530

But why stop there? Why not have even more methods? In fact, let's put EVERY METHOD on one Base class!

So I did. It's called Base. Just subclass it and feel free to directly reference any class method, instance method, or constant defined on any module or class in the system. Like this:

    class Cantaloupe < Base
      def embiggen
        encode64(deflate(SEPARATOR))
      end
    end

    >> Cantaloupe.new.embiggen
    => "eJzTBwAAMAAw\n"

See that `embiggen` method calling encode64 and deflate methods? Those come from the `Base64` and `Zlib` modules. And the `SEPARATOR` constant is defined in `File`. Base don't give a shit where it's defined! Base just calls what it wants!

By the way, remember those 530 ActiveRecord methods? That's amateur stuff. Check out Base loaded inside a Rails app:

    >> Base.new.methods.count
    => 6947

It's so badass that it takes FIVE SECONDS just to answer that question! 

Base is just craaazzy! It's the most fearless class in all of Ruby. Base has no regard for any other object. Base really doesn't give a shit!

## SHOULD I USE THIS IN MY SYSTEM?

Yes. I am being completely serious. You should.

Definitely.
